It can create virtual/fake/emulated controllers, which DS4Windows uses to spawn virtual Xbox and DS4 controllers. Nefarius' HidHide The HidHide driver allows the user to \"hide\" gamepads from the system and make them detectable to only chosen programs in order to prevent the infamous double input issue . Travis Nickles' FakerInput DS4Windows uses the FakerInput driver to expose system-wide virtual keyboard, relative mouse and absolute mouse. Allows Keyboard + Mouses events/commands to be usable in some situations where the usual way DS4Windows sends those commands (via \"SendInput) fails. Examples of those situations are elevated processes and games, UAC prompts and anti-cheat systems that block SentInput events. Use of FakerInput is necessary to allow DS4Windows to work with some games with anti-cheat protection like valorant. Legacy drivers Nefarius' HidGuardian HidGuardian is a driver that can hide controllers from the system and allow only chosen processes to detect them. It was previously used by DS4Windows to solve the double input issue, but was made obsolete by the release of its successor, HidHide, a similar driver that works better and is easier to use. DS4Windows removed support for HidGuardian in version 3.0.8 in favor of HidHide. As such, users who used and still have HidGuardian installed can be in a state where their controllers are hidden and undetectable to Windows and DS4Windows, though the controllers should still appear on Windows' Devices and Printers. Virtual Gamepad Emulation Bus (ScpVBus) Necessary to confirm the information here The ScpVBus driver is used to create fake/virtual/emulated Xbox 360 controllers. It was made obsolete by the release of its successor, the ViGEmBus driver. Usually, users accidentaly install this driver when they search for \"DS4Windows\" on google and end-up clicking on the first result that appears, which leads to the original (but now obsolete) version of DS4Windows from the developer Jays2kings. ScpVBus is not used anymore by Ryochan7's DS4Windows besides for experimenting purposes on special testing builds. Therefore, this driver has no use for the average user and it's better if it were to be uninstalled if it's present, since it has a minor chance of causing issues with Windows.","title":"DS4Windows companion drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#ds4windows-companion-drivers","text":"Under construction \u2692\ufe0f","title":"DS4Windows companion drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#general-info","text":"","title":"General info"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#required-and-optional-drivers","text":"","title":"Required and optional drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#nefarius-virtual-gamepad-emulation-bus-nefarius-vigembus","text":"The ViGEmBus driver is the most important driver used by DS4Windows.

It creates a virtual gamepad that is associated to your real one. This means that if you have 1 real gamepad connected then windows will actually detect 2 gamepads. If 2 real then 4 and so on. The image below shows how Windows behaves when a DS4v2 (Wireless Controller) is connected to the system while DS4Windows is emulating a Xbox gamepad: If the game detects both the real and the virtual gamepad at the same time then it will receive commands from 2 different devices at every button press and stick movement, which can lead to the infamous double-input issue that can make games unplayable. The fix to this is to prevent games/the system from detecting your real gamepad, leaving visible only the virtual one associated to it. This can be done in two ways: HidHide (recommended) DS4Windows' Hide DS4 Controllers option (legacy option) Methods to prevent it HidHide (recommended) Important After installing the HidHide driver you MUST reboot your system before using it If HidHide is properly configured then the Hide DS4 controllers on DS4Windows' Settings tab is redundant and should be left disabled HidHide is a driver that acts as a barrier between Windows and every HID Device connected (physical peripherals). It allows the user to selectively hide gamepads and only allow specific software to see them. This is the recommended method because once it has been properly setup you are good to go. In DS4W case, the user needs to set HidHide to: Hide the used gamepads from the system, once when connect via USB and once when via Bluetooth Allow DS4Windows to see all hidden devices, otherwise it would think there are no supported gamepads connected HidHide has its own dedicated setup page . Users who know more or less what they are doing can follow the quick setup section and for the ones having trouble there is also the step-by-step section. Hide DS4 Controllers option (legacy) Though it is written \"DS4 Controllers\" it applies to any real controller detected by DS4Windows Note to users of HidHide If you have HidHide installed and correctly setup it's recommended to leave this option disabled except in some really specific games This option exists on DS4Windows' Settings tab. When enabled, DS4Windows will kindly ask Windows for exclusive access to detected devices, meaning the later would only allow DS4Windows to detect the gamepads and preventing the double input issue. The problem with this method is that Windows can deny the exclusive access request when another process already has a open connection to the gamepad. Common reasons for this request to fail are: A game already is running Google chrome/Opera is running (why does it have a connection to the gamepad you ask? A mystery) Nvidia Geforce experience process having a hold of the gamepad Random non-obvious process having a hold of the gamepad etc Even if it works initially, if your gamepad disconnects in the middle of a game chances are that you'll lose exclusive access upon reconnection, requiring you to close the game to try again. For the reasons explained above, the Hide DS4 Controllers option is NOT RECOMMENDED , though it remains available to users that need to use it for whatever reason.

Even games that were released for Playstation consoles sometimes don't have native DS4 support on the PC, and there is nothing that can be done besides switching to Xbox controller emulation. A good (but not 100% reliable) way to confirm if a game has native DS4 support is by locating it on the Pc Gaming Wiki and looking for the \"Input settings\" section. Look carefully, sometimes it is quite hidden, so make sure to expand menus when applicable. Still, most games that have support for DS4 controllers don't actually have rumble support, so be warned. Some games also can be modded to include PS button icons while using Xbox controllers, though it's not possible to cover this here and so you'll have to google it yourself.

Though it's quite uncommon, some games have DS4 controller support only when launched through Steam and using its Playstation Configuration Support option. Keep in mind that for using your virtual DS4 controller with Steam you'll have to run DS4Windows under a custom name for Steam to not ignore it (thanks for not giving us the option on this and making our lives harder, Steam). Game not recognizing the virtual Xbox controller or stops recognizing it upon controller reconnection This may be related to a somewhat known Windows issue. Windows associates Xbox controllers to XInput slots from 1 to 4. Some games require the main controller to be in XInput Slot 1, otherwise they just don't detect them. To check which slot your virtual Xbox controller is into, go into DS4Windows' Settings tab, open the XInput Checker tool and check if the status of slot #1 is connected and if it's actually your controller by testing it. If slot #1 is disconnected, verify all the other slots. If your controller is not in slot #1 then that may be the reason the game is ignoring the controller. This is solvable but it's mostly outside of DS4Windows control and is more of a Windows issue. Check the dedicated Xinput Slots issues page for more info on this and how to solve it.

This page is dedicated to explaining why it fails to work sometimes, showing alternatives and, in case the user really needs this option for some reason, to finding out exactly why it's failing and how to solve it. Why it's not recommended When Hide DS4 controllers option is enabled, DS4Windows will attempt to request Exclusive Access to detected controllers, meaning your real (physical) controller would not be detectable by games anymore. By keeping only DS4Windows' virtual controller visible the double input issue can be prevented. The problem is, if anything already has an open handle to the controller (games, programs, processes) then Windows will deny the Exclusive Access request and your real controller will remain visible. When this happens, DS4Windows will warn the user via the log tab as shown in the image below: Even when it does work, if the controller disconnects in the middle of a game chances are that the Excluse Access request will fail upon controller reconnection, requiring the user to close the game/related programs before trying again. As such, this option is not realible and alternatives should be used. Recommended alternatives (HidHide) The recommended, trustworthy solution for preventing the double input issue is the HidHide driver . Once it has been installed and properly configured , the user's real controller will be hidden from games and other programs, with only DS4Windows and other chosen processes allowed to detect them. Applications known to cause problems with exclusive mode Important Even if it looks like a program is not open, sometimes it has a background process running, requiring the user to terminate it via Windows' Task Manager. To solve problems with exclusive mode you should try to close all other applications which may be using the real controller and then try to re-connect it (or ->Stop ->Start DS4Windows). If DS4Windows tool is the first application opening a connection to the controller then Exclusive Access can be acquireed and the real controller hidden. After Exclusive Access is obtained it will remain active until DS4Windows is stopped/started or the controller is reconnected. Following list is NOT a complete list of applications which may be running in your system in the background and may have an open connection to the original DS4 controller. Sometimes very unexpected application may have an open connection to Dualshock4 controller without your knowledge and this way preventing DS4Windows tool to enable \"Hide DS4 Controller\" exclusive mode. NVIDIA GeForce Experience and in-game overlay Disable GeForce in-game overlay feature in NVIDIA options or enable it only after you have started DS4Windows tool. Steam client Steam client supports \"big screen mode\" and various gamepad controllers (including DualShock4). Disable gamepad support in Steam client at least for DualShock4 device type. Ubisoft UPlay client UPlay supports gamepad navigation. Close UPlay client before launching DS4Windows tool. Windows Store application Windows Store application supports gamepad controller navigations. Shutdown WinStore.app.exe process before launching DS4Windows tool. You can launch WinStore application after DS4Windows has already enabled the exclusive mode. Netflix (Win 10 app) Netflix client supports gamepad navigation. Close Netflix client and terminate its process before opening DS4Windows tool. Microsoft Edge The Microsoft Edge browser window needs to be closed and the background task must be ended in Task Manager. You can use local group policy tool to disable automatic startup of Edge background processes on system boot. See the following web page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/group-policies/prelaunch-preload-gp how to disable two Edge related group policy entries. JoyToKey The JoyToKey is another gamepad remap tool. Some users have reported that having both DS4Windows and JoyToKey apps running may lead to problems when a gamepad is disconnected. Exclusive mode doesn't work when a gamepad is re-connected after a disconnection or DS4Windows doesn't recognize DS4 gamepad at all. GameBar (Win 10) GameBar.exe may hold a open connection to the original DualShock4 controller. You can disable the Game bar in Settings -> Gaming -> Turn off 'Record game clips, screenshots and broadcast using Game bar', and unselect 'Open Game bar using this button on a controller'. Oculus Rift tools If you have installed Oculus Rift VR tools then there may be a background process using a gamepad. Stop \"Oculus Rift VR runtime service\" background service and launch it after DS4Windows application has started and acquired the exclusive lock to a DS4 gamepad. Backgroundtransferhost This native Windows feature may interfere with exclusive mode. Going to Settings --> Accounts --> Sync your Settings then turn sync off. If that fails to work, the other solution involves regedit - which requires changing the \"Start\" value in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TimeBroker (or timebrokersvs) to 4, a detailed guide can be found here . Finding exactly which process has an open handle to the controller Advanced stuff! The application Process Explorer can be used to find out which process currently has an open handle on the DS4 and making exclusive mode fail. The scan takes a little bit of time but it is helpful in finding problem applications.

In DS4Windows case, we refer to the time it takes for the system/DS4Windows to communicate with the controller. A high latency means a high input delay in games, meaning the time it takes for your character to respond to the controller commands. A high but stable input delay will make the users' character feel slow to respond, while a low input delay with high delay spikes may make the user prone to errors because of unexpected slow respond times. It's often considered that a really bad high latency is one where the input delay is above 20ms, though the ideal is to keep it bellow 10ms. Usual controller latency The following table can be used as reference for comparison on what input delay to expect with a supported controller and a good Bluetooth adapter: Take these values with a grain of salt No major technical experiments were done to obtain these values besides checking what DS4Windows usually informs when those controllers are used at maximum BT polling rate Controller Usual input delay Minimum input delay Notes DualShock 3 5ms 5ms Connected through BthPS3 + DsHidMini (DS4Windows Mode) DualShock 4 4ms - DS4W Default settings 1,5ms - polling rate set to maximum v1 and v2 don't have major latency differences DualSense 3ms 1ms Switch Pro controllers 16ms 16ms 16ms is the lowest latency the official controller can achieve Joy-cons 16ms? 16ms? Monitoring input delay You can check the current input delay by hovering your mouse above the controllers name on the Controllers tab (check the image above) If the controller's latency goes over 10ms then it will appear on the Log If you have a DualShock 3, DualShock 4 or DualSense you can enable the Flash Lighbar at High latency option in the Settings tab, which will make the lightbar flash in a red color when latency spikes are detected. For the DualShock 3 you need to have DsHidMini's Lightbar to LED translation enabled, then latency spikes will cause all 4 LEDs to quickly flash Input delay issues In case you are having issues with input delay, keep something in mind: DS4Windows itself is probably not the cause of whatever high input latency/latency spikes that you may have! 98% chance of the issue being elsewhere. Controllers do not communicate directly with DS4Windows via some driver, they connect to the default Windows' Bluetooth Stack and DS4Windows just receives and sends data to it through the channels given by Windows. If you are having latency issues then installing/uninstalling drivers won't fix them unless they are directly related to your dongle's driver. For this reason, messing with DS4Windows' related drivers will probably be a waste of time. Latency issues always boils down to: Low quality Bluetooth adapters (most integrated ones) High radio interference near the adapter Too many devices connected to the adapter Not using the correct/updated BT adapter's driver Causes of high or unstable latency Note on \"Bad\" BT adapters Keep in mind that when the term \"bad\" is used it does not necessarily mean \"cheap\". Multiple users have confirmed they have no latency issues even with 4 controllers connected with cheap, generic $5 adapters from Aliexpress Bluetooth and WiFi interference Both use the same frequency. Although they should auto adjust to prevent interference, sometimes it just happens. Check if your area isn't overloaded with different 2.4Ghz WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices. Integrated or bad Bluetooth adapters It's quite common for integrated BT adapters to suck for one of the following reasons: They are inside the laptop's shell or inside a case that act as an obstacle to the signal The Bluetooth adapter also is the WiFi adapter and they are both interfering at each other They are just being overrall bad. Integrated BT adapters generally have short range and can't maintain the minimum data rate necessary when connecting more than 1 controller. Good integrated adapters are the exception, not the norm Though the minimum BT specification required for most modern controllers is the 2.1 specs, more modern adapters should have better signal stability. Multiple connected controllers Each connected controller means more data that is being transferred through the Bluetooth adapter. If you have a bad adapter or high radio interference near it it may not be able to maintain the required data rate between the system and controllers, causing high latency or even connection loss. Not much can be done besides trying to lower the interference or replacing the adater with a better one. A good quality adapter can easily maintain a stable, low latency connection with 4 controllers or even more. DS4Windows settings Some general info on DS4Windows and mainly DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers. When a DS4 or DualSense is first connected to it, they present themselves in a limited form. They don't send the data related to rumble, motion sensors, lightbar etc. Meaning they are sending just basic buttons and axis states info and Windows is basically not sending anything back. After DS4Windows first detects the controller a special request is sent for it to change into full feature mode, where the missing info starts being sent. DS4Windows also starts then sending rumble, lightbar and triggers (DualSense only) data back to it. Mind you, Steam sends the same request when the Playstation Configuration Support option is enabled. This change from limited to full feature mode results in a increase of data rate between the controller and the system and sometimes the adapter can't keep up with it. So, if your never had latency problems when using your DS4/DualSense in games with generic controller support but then start having them after start using DS4Windows or Steam, this is the cause. Potential fixes to latency issues Test with WiFi fully disabled This test is recommended for those with integrated cards that work as both BT and WiFi adapters By disabling the WiFi signal you have one less source of radio interference so you can then verify your BT adapter performance in a environment with less signal noise. Keep wifi enabled devices far from the PC too. Settings Windows' Power Plan to High Performance Set the power saving plan of the PC to \"High Performance\" (usually the default in Win10 is balanced) On Windows' Device Manager locate your Bluetooth Dongle -> Enter its properties -> Check if there is a tab called Power Management and disable the turn off this device to save power (untick the option) Use a dedicated BT adapter Recommended for users of integrated BT adapter users A dedicated, good quality BT USB Adapter should offer better performance than a integrated one. Because its antenna is located outside of the laptop/desktop's shell, it also suffers less from signal loss caused by physical obstacles. Because Windows can only use 1 BT adapter, when using a USB adapter in a PC that also has a integrated one the later must be disabled in Windows' Device Manager in order for the USB BT adapter one to be used. Moving the adapter to another USB port Moving the dongle to a better located USB port may offer a better quality signal. Also, USB ports (specially 3.0 and above) can be a source of radio noise. Test the dongle in different ports to verify which offer you a better signal. Connect USB BT adapter through a USB extension cable A laptop/desktop's shell is a source of radio noise, specially near high powered, high data transfer ports like USB 3.0 and above. This noise may worsen your BT's adapter performance. Connecting your BT adapter through a cable extension so it stays located at some distance from the computers shell is known to be useful in these cases. Decrease the BT polling rate on profile settings Only works with DS4 gamepads. The BT polling rates of other types cannot be controlled On Profile Editor -> Other tab it's possible to set the BT Poll Rate used for DS4 and DualSense controllers on Bluetooth. If you are having latency issues, specially with multiple controllers connected, try setting this value to 10ms or more. For most games, a controller input delay is only noticeable above 16ms. Disable output data to the controller Your adapter may not be up to the task to both receive and send data to the controller. In this case, you can set a profile with the Enable output data to DS4 option disabled. Keep in mind that disabling this option will also disable Rumble and Lightbar control.","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#latencyinput-delay-issues-on-bluetooth","text":"","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#general-information","text":"A connection latency is how much time it takes for one system to communicate to another.
