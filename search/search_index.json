This page contains a list of all drivers that were currently or previously associated to it. General info Required and optional drivers Nefarius' Virtual Gamepad Emulation Bus (Nefarius' ViGEmBus) The ViGEmBus driver is the most important driver used by DS4Windows. It can create virtual/fake/emulated controllers, which DS4Windows uses to spawn virtual Xbox and DS4 controllers. Nefarius' HidHide The HidHide driver allows the user to \"hide\" gamepads from the system and make them detectable to only chosen programs in order to prevent the infamous double input issue . Travis Nickles' FakerInput DS4Windows uses the FakerInput driver to expose system-wide virtual keyboard, relative mouse and absolute mouse. Allows Keyboard + Mouses events/commands to be usable in some situations where the usual way DS4Windows sends those commands (via \"SendInput) fails. Examples of those situations are elevated processes and games, UAC prompts and anti-cheat systems that block SentInput events. Use of FakerInput is necessary to allow DS4Windows to work with some games with anti-cheat protection like valorant. Legacy drivers Nefarius' HidGuardian HidGuardian is a driver that can hide controllers from the system and allow only chosen processes to detect them. It was previously used by DS4Windows to solve the double input issue, but was made obsolete by the release of its successor, HidHide, a similar driver that works better and is easier to use. DS4Windows removed support for HidGuardian in version 3.0.8 in favor of HidHide. As such, users who used and still have HidGuardian installed can be in a state where their controllers are hidden and undetectable to Windows and DS4Windows, though the controllers should still appear on Windows' Devices and Printers. Virtual Gamepad Emulation Bus (ScpVBus) Necessary to confirm the information here The ScpVBus driver is used to create fake/virtual/emulated Xbox 360 controllers. It was made obsolete by the release of its successor, the ViGEmBus driver. Usually, users accidentally install this driver when they search for \"DS4Windows\" on google and end-up clicking on the first result that appears, which leads to the original (but now obsolete) version of DS4Windows from the developer Jays2kings which prompts the user to install it. ScpVBus is not used anymore by Ryochan7's DS4Windows besides for experimenting purposes on special testing builds. Therefore, this driver has no use for the average user and it's better if it were to be uninstalled if it's present, since it has a minor chance of causing issues with Windows.","title":"Companion drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#companion-drivers","text":"To properly function or to have its capabilities improved, DS4Windows makes use of first and third-party drivers, some of which are required while others are optional.

Though USB cables are the most reliable, connecting controller wirelessly via Bluetooth will offer similar response times (input delay) and stable connections as long as a good quality BT adapter is being used and no major radio interference is affecting the connection. If facing issues, either when connecting wired or wirelessly, then have a look at the related links at the bottom of the page. Connection methods USB Should be as simple as just plugging your controller with a good, working USB cable Windows should play a \"device has been detected\" sound when the controller is plugged in Keep in mind that some USB cables can only be used for charging. If the cable does not support data transfer then it won't be of use Bluetooth Most of what is written here does not apply to DualShock 3 controllers. If using one, be sure to follow it's dedicated guide Make sure your BT adapter has the minimum specs for your controller The controller needs to be set into pairing mode to be added as a Bluetooth device through Windows' settings.

To pair a DualShock 4 to it, both must be set to pairing mode. For the Wireless Adapter, its main body must be slightly pressed towards the USB port (until a \"click\" is felt) then hold it down in this position for 3 seconds, with its LED flashing in a heartbeat pattern indicating that it's in pairing mode. Set then DualShock 4 into pairing mode (check the previous section) and it it should connect to the adapter.

The image below shows how Windows behaves when a DS4v2 (Wireless Controller) is connected to the system while DS4Windows is emulating a Xbox gamepad: If the game detects both the real and the virtual gamepad at the same time then it will receive commands from 2 different devices at every button press and stick movement, which can lead to the infamous double-input issue that can make games unplayable. Alternatively, the game may end-up ignoring the virtual controller because it has picked the real controller first. When this happens, it may also be unable to read its commands, which can create a dead-lock state where nothing happens. To prevent or fix those issues it's necessary to make only DS4Windows' virtual controller be visible to games by hiding the real controller.

If it is, remove it as per the previous section Follow the instructions in the dedicated Connecting your controllers to the PC page Windows can't find the controller when trying to add it in Bluetooth & Other Devices MAKE SURE YOUR DEVICE IS IN PAIRING MODE! For most controllers a 2.1 Bluetooth adapter is required Windows will not detect the device if it already is on its paired devices list. In this case, it is recommended to remove it from the list and pair it again If the controller has been previously connected to the PC but does not appear on the list anymore, check if it still exists on Windows' Devices and Printers Controller connects and stays connected but Windows / DS4Windows does not recognize it If you're using a controller from your gaming console (PS3, PS4, PS5, Switch) make sure it has not accidentally connected to it/turned it on. It is recommended to fully turn off/unplug it when first attempting to pair the controller to the PC If this is not the case, check the dedicated controller detection issues page Controller always needs to be fully removed and re-paired to connect / Controller does not reconnect after system reboot, sleep or shutdown cycle General info If using a USB BT adapter it may be a compatibility issue between the adapter and the USB port being used. Test the adapter in other USB ports (un-pair the controller before moving the adapter) Sometimes this issue is caused by BT adapters that were were made for 2.0 USB ports being used in 3.0 ones It's possible that your BT adapter model is just not fully compatible. Test with a different adapter Possible issues with BT adapter driver. Even if your BT adapter appears to work, check if there isn't a specific manufacter's driver that is required for it to properly function For users of BthPS3 + DsHidMini / Shibari Refer to BthPS3's documentation for proper understanding on BthPS3 behavior with DS4/DualSense controllers. Too Long, Didn't Read: If you don't use DS3 controllers in your PC then you probably don't have the BthPS3 driver Usualy, there is no actual issue besides the user having to turn on DS4/DualSense controllers 2 or 3 times before it actually manages to reconnect High input delay issues / latency spikes Check the dedicated Input delay on Bluetooth page for more info on this. Controller connects and can be used as usual with DS4Windows, but sometimes randomly disconnects or stop responding Important If you are seeing the Add a device notification when trying to reconnect your controller then it is actually not properly paired. Check the \"How to properly pair the controller\" section on this page Generally causes by a bad Bluetooth signal stability. Refer to the Input delay on Bluetooth page for more related info Possible faulty controller or dying controller battery Check DS4Windows' log for error messages Verify if the issue does not occur when DS4Windows or Steam are not running Keep in mind that using some controllers (DS4, DualSense) with DS4W or Steam makes them transfer more data, thus making them more prone to lose connection if your BT adapter is not up to the task Cannot connect more than 1 controller / Connection loss when multiple controllers are used Caused by a bad quality BT adapter or high signal interference BT adapter can't mantain the necessary data rate Refer to the Input delay on Bluetooth page for more related info Windows using integrated BT adapter instead of the external/USB adapter To Do Add pictures and improve general text description The integrated BT adapter must be disable on Windows' Device Manager: Press Win + X on the keyboard and select Device Manager on the appearing selection window Locate the integrated BT adapter under the Bluetooth section and disable it Replug the dedicated adapter or try disabling and enabling it again Loss of WiFi signal if controller is connected via BT or Loss of BT connection when WiFi is being used A integrated card that double as both the Bluetooth and Wifi adapter is probably being used and its signal quality is so bad one is interfering with another.

Pairing a controller to Windows Correct method User manually makes Windows look out for a device that is in pairing mode Incorrect method User simply turns on the controller and tries to accept the Add a device notification Controller has been accidentally disabled Happens mostly to users of the Hide DS4 controllers option Although this problem mainly affected older versions of DS4Windows (text written after version 1.5.15) for various reasons, other mapping programs can cause the same problem to occur There is a chance that DS4W has permanently disabled your controller in a previous attempt of gaining Exclusive Access when using the Hide DS4 controllers option. Though this can happen via any connection method, on Bluetooth removing and re-pairing the controller will fix the issue. On USB, the easiest way to verify this is by checking if the controller works properly in other USB ports, though another indication for DS4 or DualSense users is that the lightbar will keep flashing yellow, indicating that the controller is only at a charging state (likewise, it will flash yellow only once then turn off if fully charged). To check if your controller is disabled: Open Windows' Devices and Printers by pressing Win + R in your keyboard, typing control printers then selecting Ok Locate your controller on the list (if it does not appear there then you are probably having a connection issue ) Right-click it, select Properties then select the Hardware tab Select the HID-compliant game controller and check its status at the bottom of the Window If disabled, re-enable it by clicking at Properties then Enable device If it was disabled then re-enabling should fix the issue.

It was made obsolete by the release of its successor, HidHide, a similar driver that works better and is easier to use. As such, DS4Windows removed support for HidGuardian in version 3.0.8 and those who still have it installed are required to uninstall it in order to continue using their controllers with DS4Windows. To verify if HidGuardian is installed and uninstall it if present, check HidGuardian's section of HidHide's guide .

This page is dedicated to explaining why it fails to work sometimes, showing alternatives and, in case the user really needs this option for some reason, to finding out exactly why it's failing and how to solve it. Why it's not recommended When the Hide DS4 controllers option is enabled, DS4Windows will attempt to request Exclusive Access to detected controllers, meaning your real (physical) controller would not be detectable by games anymore. By keeping only DS4Windows' virtual controller visible the double input issue can be prevented. The problem is, if anything already has an open handle to the controller (games, programs, processes) then Windows will deny the Exclusive Access request and your real controller will remain visible. When this happens, DS4Windows will warn the user via the log tab as shown in the image below: Even when it does work, if the controller disconnects in the middle of a game chances are that the Excluse Access request will fail upon controller reconnection, requiring the user to close the game/related programs before trying again. As such, this option is not realible and alternatives should be used. Recommended alternatives (HidHide) The recommended, trustworthy solution for preventing the double input issue is the HidHide driver . Once it has been installed and properly configured , the user's real controller will be hidden from games and other programs, with only DS4Windows and other chosen processes allowed to detect them. Applications known to cause problems with exclusive mode Important Even if it looks like a program is not open, sometimes it has a background process running, requiring the user to terminate it via Windows' Task Manager. To solve problems with exclusive mode you should try to close all other applications which may be using the real controller and then try to re-connect it (or ->Stop ->Start DS4Windows). If DS4Windows tool is the first application opening a connection to the controller then Exclusive Access can be acquireed and the real controller hidden. After Exclusive Access is obtained it will remain active until DS4Windows is stopped/started or the controller is reconnected. Following list is NOT a complete list of applications which may be running in your system in the background and may have an open connection to the original DS4 controller. Sometimes very unexpected application may have an open connection to Dualshock4 controller without your knowledge and this way preventing DS4Windows tool to enable \"Hide DS4 Controller\" exclusive mode. NVIDIA GeForce Experience and in-game overlay Disable GeForce in-game overlay feature in NVIDIA options or enable it only after you have started DS4Windows tool. Steam client Steam client supports \"big screen mode\" and various gamepad controllers (including DualShock4). Disable gamepad support in Steam client at least for DualShock4 device type. Ubisoft UPlay client UPlay supports gamepad navigation. Close UPlay client before launching DS4Windows tool. Windows Store application Windows Store application supports gamepad controller navigations. Shutdown WinStore.app.exe process before launching DS4Windows tool. You can launch WinStore application after DS4Windows has already enabled the exclusive mode. Netflix (Win 10 app) Netflix client supports gamepad navigation. Close Netflix client and terminate its process before opening DS4Windows tool. Microsoft Edge The Microsoft Edge browser window needs to be closed and the background task must be ended in Task Manager. You can use local group policy tool to disable automatic startup of Edge background processes on system boot. See the following web page https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/deploy/group-policies/prelaunch-preload-gp how to disable two Edge related group policy entries. JoyToKey The JoyToKey is another gamepad remap tool. Some users have reported that having both DS4Windows and JoyToKey apps running may lead to problems when a gamepad is disconnected. Exclusive mode doesn't work when a gamepad is re-connected after a disconnection or DS4Windows doesn't recognize your physical gamepad at all. GameBar (Win 10) GameBar.exe may hold a open connection to your physical controller. You can disable the Game bar in Settings -> Gaming -> Turn off 'Record game clips, screenshots and broadcast using Game bar', and unselect 'Open Game bar using this button on a controller'. Oculus Rift tools If you have installed Oculus Rift VR tools then there may be a background process using a gamepad. Stop \"Oculus Rift VR runtime service\" background service and launch it after DS4Windows application has started and acquired the exclusive lock to your physical gamepad. Backgroundtransferhost This native Windows feature may interfere with exclusive mode. Going to Settings --> Accounts --> Sync your Settings then turn sync off.

In DS4Windows case, we refer to the time it takes for the system/DS4Windows to communicate with the controller. A high latency means a high input delay in games, meaning the time it takes for your character to respond to the controller commands. A high but stable input delay will make the users' character feel slow to respond, while a low input delay with high delay spikes may make the user prone to errors because of unexpected slow respond times. It's often considered that a really bad high latency is one where the input delay is above 20ms, though the ideal is to keep it bellow 10ms. Usual controller latency The following table can be used as reference for comparison on what input delay to expect with a supported controller and a good Bluetooth adapter: Take these values with a grain of salt No major technical experiments were done to obtain these values besides checking what DS4Windows usually informs when those controllers are used at maximum BT polling rate Controller Usual input delay Minimum input delay Notes DualShock 3 5ms 5ms Connected through BthPS3 + DsHidMini (DS4Windows Mode) DualShock 4 4ms - DS4W Default settings 1,5ms - polling rate set to maximum v1 and v2 don't have major latency differences DualSense 3ms 1ms Switch Pro controllers 16ms 16ms 16ms is the lowest latency the official controller can achieve Joy-cons 16ms? 16ms? Monitoring input delay You can check the current input delay by hovering your mouse above the controllers name on the Controllers tab (check the image above) If the controller's latency goes over 10ms then it will appear on the Log If you have a DualShock 3, DualShock 4 or DualSense you can enable the Flash Lighbar at High latency option in the Settings tab, which will make the lightbar flash in a red color when latency spikes are detected. For the DualShock 3 you need to have DsHidMini's Lightbar to LED translation enabled, then latency spikes will cause all 4 LEDs to quickly flash Input delay issues In case you are having issues with input delay, keep something in mind: DS4Windows itself is probably not the cause of whatever high input latency/latency spikes that you may have! 98% chance of the issue being elsewhere. Controllers do not communicate directly with DS4Windows via some driver, they connect to the default Windows' Bluetooth Stack and DS4Windows just receives and sends data to it through the channels given by Windows. If you are having latency issues then installing/uninstalling drivers won't fix them unless they are directly related to your dongle's driver. For this reason, messing with DS4Windows' related drivers will probably be a waste of time. Latency issues always boils down to: Low quality Bluetooth adapters (most integrated ones) High radio interference near the adapter Too many devices connected to the adapter Not using the correct/updated BT adapter's driver Causes of high or unstable latency Note on \"Bad\" BT adapters Keep in mind that when the term \"bad\" is used it does not necessarily mean \"cheap\". Multiple users have confirmed they have no latency issues even with 4 controllers connected with cheap, generic $5 adapters from Aliexpress Bluetooth and WiFi interference Both use the same frequency. Although they should auto adjust to prevent interference, sometimes it just happens. Check if your area isn't overloaded with different 2.4Ghz WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices. Integrated or bad Bluetooth adapters It's quite common for integrated BT adapters to suck for one of the following reasons: They are inside the laptop's shell or inside a case that act as an obstacle to the signal The Bluetooth adapter also is the WiFi adapter and they are both interfering at each other They are just being overrall bad. Integrated BT adapters generally have short range and can't maintain the minimum data rate necessary when connecting more than 1 controller. Good integrated adapters are the exception, not the norm Though the minimum BT specification required for most modern controllers is the 2.1 specs, more modern adapters should have better signal stability. Multiple connected controllers Each connected controller means more data that is being transferred through the Bluetooth adapter. If you have a bad adapter or high radio interference near it it may not be able to maintain the required data rate between the system and controllers, causing high latency or even connection loss. Not much can be done besides trying to lower the interference or replacing the adater with a better one. A good quality adapter can easily maintain a stable, low latency connection with 4 controllers or even more. DS4Windows settings Some general info on DS4Windows and mainly DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers. When a DS4 or DualSense is first connected to it, they present themselves in a limited form. They don't send the data related to rumble, motion sensors, lightbar etc. Meaning they are sending just basic buttons and axis states info and Windows is basically not sending anything back. After DS4Windows first detects the controller a special request is sent for it to change into full feature mode, where the missing info starts being sent. DS4Windows also starts then sending rumble, lightbar and triggers (DualSense only) data back to it. Mind you, Steam sends the same request when the Playstation Configuration Support option is enabled. This change from limited to full feature mode results in a increase of data rate between the controller and the system and sometimes the adapter can't keep up with it. So, if your never had latency problems when using your DS4/DualSense in games with generic controller support but then start having them after start using DS4Windows or Steam, this is the cause. Potential fixes to latency issues Test with WiFi fully disabled This test is recommended for those with integrated cards that work as both BT and WiFi adapters By disabling the WiFi signal you have one less source of radio interference so you can then verify your BT adapter performance in a environment with less signal noise. Keep wifi enabled devices far from the PC too. Settings Windows' Power Plan to High Performance Set the power saving plan of the PC to \"High Performance\" (usually the default in Win10 is balanced) On Windows' Device Manager locate your Bluetooth Dongle -> Enter its properties -> Check if there is a tab called Power Management and disable the turn off this device to save power (untick the option) Use a dedicated BT adapter Recommended for users of integrated BT adapter users A dedicated, good quality BT USB Adapter should offer better performance than a integrated one. Because its antenna is located outside of the laptop/desktop's shell, it also suffers less from signal loss caused by physical obstacles. Because Windows can only use 1 BT adapter, when using a USB adapter in a PC that also has a integrated one the later must be disabled in Windows' Device Manager in order for the USB BT adapter one to be used. Moving the adapter to another USB port Moving the dongle to a better located USB port may offer a better quality signal. Also, USB ports (specially 3.0 and above) can be a source of radio noise. Test the dongle in different ports to verify which offer you a better signal. Connect USB BT adapter through a USB extension cable A laptop/desktop's shell is a source of radio noise, specially near high powered, high data transfer ports like USB 3.0 and above. This noise may worsen your BT's adapter performance. Connecting your BT adapter through a cable extension so it stays located at some distance from the computers shell is known to be useful in these cases. Decrease the BT polling rate on profile settings Only works with DS4 gamepads. The BT polling rates of other types cannot be controlled On Profile Editor -> Other tab it's possible to set the BT Poll Rate used for DS4 and DualSense controllers on Bluetooth. If you are having latency issues, specially with multiple controllers connected, try setting this value to 10ms or more. For most games, a controller input delay is only noticeable above 16ms. Disable output data to the controller Your adapter may not be up to the task to both receive and send data to the controller. In this case, you can set a profile with the Enable output data to DS4 option disabled. Keep in mind that disabling this option will also disable Rumble and Lightbar control.","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#latencyinput-delay-issues-on-bluetooth","text":"","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#general-information","text":"A connection latency is how much time it takes for one system to communicate to another.

To not keep repeating information all over the site, check the double input page for more information on that. Make sure your real controller is 100% hidden before playing games, otherwise you might start having double input/controller issues and mistake them for something else. Making sure your real controller is hidden DS4Windows' virtual controller could also be a Wireless Controller (DualShock 4) depending on your profile settings Shared (real controller not hidden) HidHide Exclusive Hide DS4 controllers legacy function This option is not recommended anymore and HidHide should be used instead Test with a new, \"clean\", properly-functioning profile It's possible that the currently active profile is misconfigured, either by incorrectly tweaking settings or by having it broken after a DS4Windows update (really rare to happen, but possible). To not go into a wild goose-chase, the very first thing that should be done is creating a new, sure-to-be-working profile: Go to DS4Windows' Profiles tab and click on the New button to start profile creation A window will appear asking if the user wants to use a Preset. Select \"Yes\" then choose a Gamepad preset with Xbox or DualShock 4 output Choose any name for this profile (e.g.: \"testing\") then save it Go back to the Controllers tab and select the new profile This should result in a good profile for troubleshooting most issues. Most common issues Character or camera moves by themselves This is usually related to a hardware issue called \"Stick drifting\" that happens when the controller's not correctly reading the stick position. Depending on the controller, it can be fixed by cleaning the sticks' resistor-meters (not so hard to people who are confident of their DIY abilities) or fully replacing the sticks (advanced stuff!). Regarding DS4Windows, the only profile options that could cause this are: The stick's anti dead zone being BIGGER than the dead zone You've enabled on the profile editor's gyro tab some option that makes the motion sensors control your controller stick If the drifting is minor then it can be worked-around by slightly increasing the controllers' dead zone on profile settings. If you are suffering from major drift then there's not much that can be done besides repairing the controller itself. Stick drift issue and workarounds When not being moved, the sticks positions must be centered Issue example (minor) The Right Stick is at the correct resting position The Left stick's horizontal axis is slightly drifting to the right ( axis 0 = ~0.16 ) This can be \"fixed\" by increasing the dead zone on the profile settings Issue example (major) The Left Stick's both axes are suffering from major drifting issues Setting a dead zone big enough to counter this might greatly affect gameplay and even make games unplayable Fixing it requires cleaning the stick sensors or replacing the stick (not for the average user) Occasionally character or camera moves in a random direction or not respond to the exact movement that is expected This is usually related to a hardware issue called \"Stick drifting\" that happens when the controller's not correctly reading the stick position. To verify: For these tests, edit the currently used profile and set both the dead zone and anti dead zone to 0.00 Remember to do this for both sticks Open the Gamepad Tester Website Do, slowly, a cross movement by makign the stick position go up-and-down, left-and-right. Test both sticks separately Also, slowly do a full circle movement a few times After that, change the (anti) dead zone values back to what they were If the stick position corresponded to the movements of the real stick then all good. If not, if somehow it jumped position or behave erratically then your controller probably is physically falty.

Usual reaction when users say it's a Windows' driver error If the issue is in the triggers, it's possible to try increasing its/their dead-zone to require pressing them further before being registered. One way to test if you are having random buttom presses is by creating a profile that has a Special action enabled that causes a profile switch to another profile when a specific button is pressed, then just leave your controller turned on and wait, or maybe try slightly touching the buttons without fully pressing them to see if its a sensibility issue. Other than that, the only thing left to do is taking the controller to the assistance. Controller stops responding randomly Unless DS4Windows is out-right crashing or appearing to be frozen (Windows says that it is not responding) then it is probably an issue with your controllers cable, its own USB port, the PC's USB port or if connected via Bluetooth then a latency issue . For wired users, try using other PC USB ports, replacing the cable or testing if the problem does not occur when connected over Bluetooth. Besides that, check if there isn't any error message in DS4Windows' Log that could give some direction on this. Game constantly or occasionally feels slow to respond to commands (high input delay sensation) May be an issue with the game itself If the controller is connected via Bluetooth then you may be having connection issues which result in high input delay or random latency spikes Controller latency can be monitored by hovering the mouse over the controllers' name on DS4Windows' main Controllers tab. Also, if the latency goes above 10ms then it will be registered on the Log tab Game feels slow to respond to commands only when using a virtual DS4 (HidHide related?) HidHide has a known issue where it causes high input delay in a few games when using a emulated DS4 controller.

Regarding DS4Windows, the only profile options that could cause this are: The stick's anti dead zone being BIGGER than the dead zone You've enabled on the profile editor's gyro tab some option that makes the motion sensors control your controller stick If the drifting is minor then it can be worked-around by slightly increasing the controllers' dead zone on profile settings.

After being associated they remain so until being unplugged, which should then make Windows clear the used slot... \"Should\". Sometimes processes keep an open handle to these slots in order to remember the previously controller order in case there is an accidental disconnection... Or sometimes those processes are badly coded and just suck. When this happens, slots can get stuck in a constant \"reserved\" state where controllers being connected or reconnected are pushed down to other XInput slots or are always reconnected to the same ones even though the user is trying to change their order. Because this is an automatic Windows process, when a slot gets stuck there is not much DS4Windows can do besides hoping the slots get freed by the offender process next time it tries to connect the virtual controller. \"Wait, where is my controller?\" \"Oh! There it is... WHAT?!\" Having stuck slots can lead to controller detection issues since some games require the main controller to be specifically in Slot 1 (or in the original slot the controller was initially detected) and some other ones have local multiplayer that make the player order directly tied to the XInput slots order. To solve this issue, it's necessary to find which programs are keeping an open handle to the XInput slots and terminating them. Verifying which slot controllers are being associated to Have at least one Xbox controller connected Go to DS4Windows' Settings tab and open the XInputChecker tool Check each slot to see which of them are connected. When finding a connected slot, make sure to confirm if it is associated t your controller by checking if it responds to commands Finding out what is keeping an open handle to XInput Slots Download and extract the Process Explorer archive Execute the procexp64.exe to open Process Explorer Click at the Find tab on the top and then select Find Handle or DLL... Search for XInput and wait for the results, it might take a few seconds for all the entries to appear Most common ofenders To Do Usually innocent processes To Do Others To Do Possible solutions and workarounds Closing programs / terminating offending processes To Do Setting a permanent output slot so DS4Windows never unplugs the virtual XBox controller Because the issue usually does not occur when a Xbox controller is connected the first time, only upon disconnection / reconnection, one way to prevent it is by setting a permanent virtual Xbox controller that is connected to the system at all times, regardless if your real physical controller is connected or disconnected. Keep in mind that this solutions has limitations since it's still possible for a permanently set controller to be disconnected in the following situations: Stopping or closing DS4Windows Suspending the system (permanent virtual controller will be disconnected on doing so and reconnected on system wake-up, but then the issue may occur) To set a permanent Xbox controller, head to DS4Windows' Output Slots tab, select the first Output Slot on the list, make sure that the X360 (Xbox 360) controller type is selected and then change it from Dynamic to Permanent . Verify then that it's working by heading to the Gamepad Tester Website , checking if the Xbox controller is present and permanent by trying to disconnect and reconnect your real controller a few times. Careful when doing DualShock 4 emulation while a permanent Xbox controller has been set If a permanent Xbox controller has been set but the user changes to a profile that has DualShock 4 emulation selected then there will be 2 controllers connected to the system: the unsued permanent Xbox and dynamically created DS4. Although this should not cause the double input issue it's better to unplug the permanent Xbox in this situation since games may detect the unused Xbox controller first and get stuck in a \"nothing happens\" situation Re-logging current Windows' user / Restarting Windows If nothing else works, it may be necessary to log off from the current Windows' user and logging in again or, if the issue persists, to restart the system.","title":"XInput slots order issues"},{"location":"troubleshooting/xinput-slots-order/#xinput-slots-order-issues","text":"Under construction \u2692\ufe0f","title":"XInput slots order issues"},{"location":"troubleshooting/xinput-slots-order/#general-info","text":"Upon connection, Xbox controllers are associated by Windows to hidden Xinput Slots that range from 1 to 4. After being associated they remain so until being unplugged, which should then make Windows clear the used slot... \"Should\". Sometimes processes keep an open handle to these slots in order to remember the previously controller order in case there is an accidental disconnection... Or sometimes those processes are badly coded and just suck. When this happens, slots can get stuck in a constant \"reserved\" state where controllers being connected or reconnected are pushed down to other XInput slots or are always reconnected to the same ones even though the user is trying to change their order. Because this is an automatic Windows process, when a slot gets stuck there is not much DS4Windows can do besides hoping the slots get freed by the offender process next time it tries to connect the virtual controller. \"Wait, where is my controller?\" \"Oh!
