This page contains a list of all drivers that were currently or previously associated to it. Required and optional drivers Nefarius' Virtual Gamepad Emulation Bus (Nefarius' ViGEmBus) The ViGEmBus driver is the most important driver used by DS4Windows. It can create virtual/fake/emulated controllers, which DS4Windows uses to spawn virtual Xbox and DS4 controllers. Nefarius' HidHide The HidHide driver allows the user to \"hide\" gamepads from the system and make them detectable to only chosen programs in order to prevent the infamous double input issue . Travis Nickles' FakerInput DS4Windows uses the FakerInput driver to expose system-wide virtual keyboard, relative mouse and absolute mouse. Allows Keyboard + Mouses events/commands to be usable in some situations where the usual way DS4Windows sends those commands (via \"SendInput) fails. Examples of those situations are elevated processes and games, UAC prompts and anti-cheat systems that block SentInput events. Use of FakerInput is necessary to allow DS4Windows to work with some games with anti-cheat protection like valorant. Legacy drivers Nefarius' HidGuardian HidGuardian is a driver that can hide controllers from the system and allow only chosen processes to detect them. It was previously used by DS4Windows to solve the double input issue, but was made obsolete by the release of its successor, HidHide, a similar driver that works better and is easier to use. DS4Windows removed support for HidGuardian in version 3.0.8 in favor of HidHide. As such, users who used and still have HidGuardian installed can be in a state where their controllers are hidden and undetectable to Windows and DS4Windows. It's highly recommended for the user to follow HidGuardian's uninstall instructions in order to verify if it's installed and how to safely remove it in case it is. Virtual Gamepad Emulation Bus (ScpVBus) Necessary to confirm the information here The ScpVBus driver is used to create fake/virtual/emulated Xbox 360 controllers. It was made obsolete by the release of its successor, the ViGEmBus driver. Usually, users accidentally install this driver when they search for \"DS4Windows\" on google and end-up clicking on the first result that appears, which leads to the original (but now obsolete) version of DS4Windows from the developer Jays2kings which prompts the user to install it. ScpVBus is not used anymore by Ryochan7's DS4Windows besides for experimenting purposes on special testing builds. Therefore, this driver has no use for the average user and it's better if it were to be uninstalled in case it's present since it has a minor chance of causing issues/BSoD on Windows.","title":"Companion drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#companion-drivers","text":"","title":"Companion drivers"},{"location":"about-ds4windows/companion-drivers/#general-info","text":"To properly function or to have its capabilities improved, DS4Windows makes use of first and third-party drivers, some of which are required while others are optional.

The Supported Gamepads page will better answer this question for you. Keep in mind that the real controller you are using is not that important for game compatibility. As long as it is detected by DS4Windows, you'll be using them as either a Xbox or DS4 gamepad via gamepad emulation. How does this program works? Newbie explanation DS4Windows works by remapping the user's \"real\" gamepad into a new, virtual / \"fake\" / emulated gamepad (check the GIF below) or by directly mapping the real gamepad to the user's keyboard and mouse. This allows: Using your gamepad in games that support (for example) only Xbox controllers It's possible to emulate either a Xbox or DS4 gamepad, but keep in mind that most games do not support DS4 controllers in any way, requiring Xbox emulation The virtual controller is fully configurable: its buttons and sticks can be remapped to other buttons/sticks or entirely disable, their behavior tweaked , special functions configured etc. Using your DS4 via Bluetooth in games that only recognize DS4 controllers connected via USB (Wired v1 DS4 emulation) Playing games that do not support gamepads by controlling the PC's keyboard and mouse Mapping the controllers motion sensors to control the mouse, sticks etc. And much more! GIF showcasing DS4Windows virtual controller in action Why games think I'm using a Xbox controller? When using DS4Windows, the real controller that you are using is mostly of no importance. What matters is the type of controller emulation set on the currently active profile (Virtual Controller Settings). On default settings DS4Windows is set to emulate Xbox controllers since most games support only this type. Though it's possible to change to DS4 emulation in the profile settings, KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST GAMES DO NOT DIRECTLY SUPPORT DS4 CONTROLLERS AND XBOX EMULATION IS REQUIRED! For some more info on games not recognizing DS4 controllers, check the games not recognizing DS4 controllers troubleshooting page . Emulated / Virtual controller? What is this? As the name suggests, it's a fake / virtual / non-physical controller. DS4Windows cannot \"transform\" the real controller you are using from one type to another, so instead it associates it to a new virtual controller in the system from the desired type. On default settings, the virtual controller is a Xbox 360 to ensure maximum game compatibility and it replicates the movements done by the real controller as if the user were directly using it. What's the advantage of using virtual controllers? The main advantages are: Virtual controllers are recognized as \"real\" by the system. As such, they work in any game or application on the system that has support for them This does not magically add gamepad support to games that do not have them or support only one type of controller. If a game works only with Xbox gamepads then you NEED to do Xbox emulation, since the game would not recognize the gamepad if you were to emulate a DS4 A game may have fixed control schemes, but the user wants to rebind a function from one button to another. By directly rebinding the virtual controller's button on DS4Windows the user completely bypass the game's limitation These are just examples, keep in mind that DS4Windows is a powerful tool that can be heavily customized to the user's preferences, as such it's hard to properly summarize what can and cannot be done. Why would I emulate a DS4 controller if I'm already using one? DS4Windows can emulate a DS4v1 connected via USB. This is useful when: You want to rebind buttons, adjust the sticks behavior etc when using a real DS4 (or any other controller) a fake/copy-cat DS4 controller is being used which the game may not recognize as an actual DS4 Your controller is connected wirelessly but the game you want to play only has (full) support to wired, version 1 DS4 controllers DS4Windows' virtual DS4 controllers are always wired/v1, regardless to the real controller being used and how it's connected Your real, physical DS4 is hidden, meaning the only way to use it with games as an actual DS4 controller is by emulating a new one \"Hiding\" the physical controllers being used with DS4W from the system is a recommended step to prevent issues with games. For more information, check the Preventing the double controller / double input issue in games page If DS4W creates a new gamepad on my system doesn't this means I end-up with 2 controllers, the real and the virtual? Yes. This can lead to an infamous problem called double input issue . Fortunaly, this can be solved by \"hiding\" the real controller being used, leaving only the virtual one visible to games and applications. Check the Preventing the double controller / double input issue in games guide for more info on this. Can I emulate other controllers besides Xbox and DS4? DS4Windows is limited to the types of virtual controller the ViGEmBus driver can create, and for now it can only spawn virtual Xbox and DS4 controllers. This may change in the future but there is no estimate. I'm having some kind of issue, how do I solve it? The Troubleshooting section of this site Is made to direct users to the info they need to \"help themselves\". Be sure to look around carefully as most known issues are already covered there somewhere, all it takes is some reading and comprehension skills and a bit of patience. I did not find how to solve my issue on the site, how do I request for direct support? To Do - Under consctruction Keep something in mind: support is only given to users that can PROVE they actually followed all applicable troubleshooting sections but still couldn't fix this problem. As such, there is a template that the user is required to fill with lots of info and images to base their claim that their issue is something that is not covered or really unexpected. USERS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE THE REQUIRED INFO WILL HAVE THEIR SUPPORT TICKETS IMMEDIATELY CLOSED! If you've read and understand that, then please click only on the final dot of the following link: Direct support page . Why isn't rumble working when doing DS4 emulation? TL;DR: Virtual DS4 rumble has been disabled Rumble is disabled when using a VIRTUAL DS4 controller, regardless of the type of real controller being used Rumble is working as normal if using a real DS4 controller and Xbox emulation There is an issue with the ViGEmBus's virtual DS4 controllers where it doesn't correctly register if a game wants to activate only the rumble or only change the lightbar color. Depending on how the game is coded to manage these functions, this may cause the rumble to never stop or the lightbar to change to the wrong color. Because of motives above and the fact that this is something unfixable by DS4Windows, the rumble and lightbar passthru functions were disabled until the next version of the ViGEmBus is released, with no estimate for when this will happen. What's the differences between using a controller with DS4Windows and using it with Steam Input? The main difference is that for Steam's controller support to work every game or application need to be launched through Steam, since it needs to directly intercepts the game's controller communication. On the other hand, DS4Windows' virtual controllers behave as real ones on the system and will work in any game or application that has support to them, including Steam games. Both tools have the same main functions while also having their own extras. In the end, the users themselves need to learn what both tools can do and how to properly use them to decide which one is better for their use case. Can I use the headphone jack port of a DS4 or DualSense controller on a PC? Only when connected via USB (official DS4v2, DualSense and some fake DS4) or when connected over Sony's official USB Wireless Adapter (DS4 controllers) For more info: Headphone or mic related issues when using supported gamepads . Will DS4Windows add suport for DS4/DualSense's headphone jack when connected via the standard Windows Bluetooth? Is it possible to implement this? Apparently yes. WILL it be implemented? The answer is probably no unless some new developer steps in to specifically focus on this. What most users don't understand is that: DS4Windows is a free, open-source software developed by a few people out of their own limited free time. Have you ever had to work, study, have fun and still have time left to work on non-paid software for random internet users? Balancing all these things is not an easy task Even minor things can be complicated to be implemented. Audio input/output over Bluetooth is complicated, specifically because there is a LOT that is not known for the lack of documentation, so sometimes it takes way too many hours of work just to test something There are other more important things to focus that actually impact gaming. if users need wireless headsets they can just buy a dedicated one. As such, this niche feature is really low on the To Do list Why does my speakers / headphones audio stop working when I connect my controller to the PC? You are probably connecting a controller that has headphone jack audio support and Windows is automatically switching to it. When this happens, the user needs to manually switch back to the preferred audio device on apps being used and on Windows itself.

Though USB cables are the most reliable, connecting controller wirelessly via Bluetooth will offer similar response times (input delay) and stable connections as long as a good quality BT adapter is being used and no major radio interference is affecting the connection. If facing issues, either when connecting wired or wirelessly, then have a look at the related links at the bottom of the page. Connection methods USB Should be as simple as just plugging your controller with a good, working USB cable Windows should play a \"device has been detected\" sound when the controller is plugged in Keep in mind that some USB cables can only be used for charging. If the cable does not support data transfer then it won't be of use Bluetooth Most of what is written here does not apply to DualShock 3 controllers. If using one, be sure to follow it's dedicated guide Make sure your BT adapter has the minimum specs for your controller The controller needs to be set into pairing mode to be added as a Bluetooth device through Windows' settings. If a pin is asked try 0000 If a controller has already been previously paired and you can't reconnect, try removing the device from Windows' Bluetooth devices list and repairing them Setting a controller into pairing mode DualShock 4 / DualSense Hold at the same time the PS + Share buttons until the lightbar starts flashing in a heartbeat pattern. Joy-con / Pro Controller Hold down the sync button until the controller LEDs enter a back n' forth pattern. Copy-cats / replicas Probably the same as the official ones If facing trouble, check the controller's manual Sony DualShock 4 USB Wireless adapter The official adapter from Sony supports only 1 controller, but allows the headphone jack to be used wireless for both audio and mic. To pair a DualShock 4 to it, both must be set to pairing mode. For the Wireless Adapter, its main body must be slightly pressed towards the USB port (until a \"click\" is felt) then hold it down in this position for 3 seconds, with its LED flashing in a heartbeat pattern indicating that it's in pairing mode. Set then DualShock 4 into pairing mode (check the previous section) and it it should connect to the adapter. Final checks Assuming everything is working as expected then DS4Windows should have no trouble detecting your controller, just make sure you haven't accidentally stopped DS4Windows (in case you have, just press DS4Windows' start button) If for whatever reason DS4Windows is failing to detect your controller or you are not sure if it has been properly connected, check the Controller Detection troubleshoot page.

It allows the user to selectively hide gamepads and only allow specific software to still detect them. It is the recommended method because once it has been properly setup the double input issue is solved for good for the hidden controller. In DS4Windows case, the user needs to set HidHide to: Hide the real controllers from the system once when connected via USB and once when via Bluetooth Allow DS4Windows to see all hidden devices, otherwise it would think there are no supported gamepads connected HidHide result HidHide Configuration Client Example: Hiding a DS4 HidHide has its own dedicated setup page . Users who know more or less what they are doing can follow the quick setup section and for the ones having trouble there is also the step-by-step section.

HidHide Configuration Client tips In order to avoid confusion, make sure DS4Windows is stopped or fully closed BEFORE opening HidHide's Client so only real controllers appear on its devices list Remember to close HidHide's Client before re-opening DS4Windows, otherwise the Ex check will fail even if the controller is correctly hidden Hide DS4 Controllers option (legacy. Not recommended) Though it is written \"DS4 Controllers\" it applies to any real controller detected by DS4Windows Note to users of HidHide If you have HidHide installed and correctly setup then this option is redudant and should be left disabled to prevent issues or confusion. This option exists on DS4Windows' Settings tab. When enabled, DS4Windows will kindly ask Windows for exclusive access to detected devices, meaning the later would only allow DS4Windows to detect the gamepads and preventing the double input issue. The problem with this method is that Windows can deny the exclusive access request when another process already has a open connection to the gamepad. Common reasons for this request to fail are: A game already is running Google chrome/Opera is running (why does it have a connection to the gamepad you ask? A mystery) Nvidia Geforce experience process having a hold of the gamepad Random non-obvious process having a hold of the gamepad etc Even if it works initially, if your gamepad disconnects in the middle of a game chances are that you'll lose exclusive access upon reconnection, requiring you to close the game to try again.

Is it connected by one of the supported methods also described on the list? Remember, currently no official gamepad exposed its audio functions when connected through Windows' Bluetooth Have you selected the gamepad's headphone or mic as the desired audio devices accordingly to the \" Switching between audio devices \" section?

Frequently Asked Questions \"Can I use my DS4/DualSense's headphone jack when connected via the standard Windows Bluetooth?\" No, this feature is not implemented. Is it possible to implement this? Apparently yes. WILL it be implemented? The answer is probably no unless some new developer steps in to specifically focus on this. What most users don't understand is that: DS4Windows is a free, open-source software developed by a few people out of their own limited free time. Have you ever had to work, study, have fun and still have time left to work on non-paid software for random internet users? Balancing all these things is not an easy task Even minor things can be complicated to be implemented.

If you don't know how to reach Windows' Game controllers' list (joy.cpl), Device Manager, Devices & Printers, \"Bluetooth & Other Devices\" settings etc. then have a look at this page General information This page is focused on troubleshooting issues that can make DS4Windows not detect your REAL controller. If you are having trouble with games recognizing your gamepad then it's actually related to detection problems with the virtual controllers DS4Windows creates . Situations that can make the controller undetectable by DS4Windows or Windows You are using obsolete or old versions of DS4Windows If you just search \"DS4Windows\" on google, chances are that the first result is the obsolete version from jays2kings, which has not been updated since 2016 and should not be used anymore. The currently maintained version you should be using is Ryochan7's DS4Windows . If in trouble, check out the installation guide . Info Obsolete Jays2Kings' DS4Windows v1.4.52 This version has not been updated since 2016 and should definitely not be used anymore Note the black DS4 icon, that there is not Output Slots tab and the max number of controllers being 4 The version you should actually be using Ryochan7' DS4Windows v3.X.X It's the currently maintained version Note the blue and pink DS4 icon, the presence of the Output Slots tab and the maximum number of controllers being 8 DS4Windows is stopped Well, it needs to actually be running for things to work, don't you agree? If it is stopped then you can press the Start button on the bottom-right to make things roll again. Controller is not properly connected / does not appear on Windows' Devices and Printers You have connected your controller to the PC but it does not appear on Windows' Devices and Printers? What? How? No, that should not be possible under normal circunstances. Your controller MUST appear there in some shape or form, even if it does not looks like a controller. When connected via... USB When connected via USB a new entry should appear, so keep an eye for it. Test on other USB ports to be sure. If literally nothing happens then maybe: You have a faulty cable Your cable can only be used for charging and does not support data transfer Your controller's or PC port is broken Bluetooth When a controller has been paired to Windows via Bluetooth then its entry will exist there regardless if the controller is currently connected or not. Also... There is a correct and a incorrect method of pairing a controller to Windows. Both will result in the controller appearing to be connected, but on the wrong way the controller won't remain connected for more than a few seconds and a Add a device notification will keep on appearing Check the dedicated Bluetooth connection issues page for more info Controller was connected to the PC via Bluetooth but was paired using the wrong method or needs to be re-paired There is a correct and a incorrect method of pairing a controller to the PC via Bluetooth. Both will result in the controller appearing to be connected, but on the incorrect method the controller won't remain connected for more than a few seconds and Windows will sometimes show a Add a device notification. Sometimes this happen when a user had previously connected the controller to the PC, removed the device and is trying to simply turn on the controller in the hopes that it will reconnect. If in doubt, fully remove the controller from Windows' Device list and re-pair it via the proper way . Pairing a controller to Windows Correct method User manually makes Windows look out for a device that is in pairing mode Incorrect method User simply turns on the controller and tries to accept the Add a device notification Controller has been accidentally disabled Happens mostly to users of the Hide DS4 controllers option Although this problem mainly affected older versions of DS4Windows (text written after version 1.5.15) for various reasons, other mapping programs can cause the same problem to occur There is a chance that DS4W has permanently disabled your controller in a previous attempt of gaining Exclusive Access when using the Hide DS4 controllers option. Though this can happen via any connection method, on Bluetooth removing and re-pairing the controller will fix the issue. On USB, the easiest way to verify this is by checking if the controller works properly in other USB ports, though another indication for DS4 or DualSense users is that the lightbar will keep flashing yellow, indicating that the controller is only at a charging state (likewise, it will flash yellow only once then turn off if fully charged). To check if your controller is disabled: Open Windows' Devices and Printers by pressing Win + R in your keyboard, typing control printers then selecting Ok Locate your controller on the list Right-click on it, select Properties then select the Hardware tab Select the HID-compliant game controller and check its status at the bottom of the Window If disabled, re-enable it by clicking at Properties then Enable device If it was disabled then re-enabling should fix the issue. Controller is enabled but hidden If you found out that: Your controller is properly connected Your controller is NOT disabled in the previous sections Still does not appear on Windows' Game Controllers list And is not detected by DS4Windows Then it may be hidden. The following tools could be the culprit: HidGuardian HidGuardian is a driver that can prevent Windows from recognizing a connected controller as an actual game controller. It was used by DS4Windows to prevent the double-input issue , but support for it was removed in v3.0.8 for 2 reasons: Users didn't know how to properly configure HidGuardian and ended up having issues that were complicated to troubleshoot and fix The release of HidGuardian's successor, HidHide, which works the same but is more user-friendly As such, the latest versions of DS4Windows won't request HidGuardian for hidden controller's access and if a controller is hidden by it then it won't be detected anymore. Users who still have HidGuardian installed must: Uninstall it for their controller to be detected again To verify if HidGuardian is installed and uninstall it if present, check the legacy drivers section of DS4Windows uninstallation guide Install HidHide as a replacement for the \"controller hiding\" function that is necessary to prevent the double input issue For more information about HidHide and the double input issue, check the Preventing the double controller / double input issue in games guide HidHide HidHide is an optional (but highly recommended) third-party driver that can hide controllers from the system and only allow chosen processes to detect them. Its use along DS4Windows is recommended in order to prevent the infamous double input issue . You can check if you have HidHide installed by opening Windows' Apps and Features and searching for it, though if it do is installed then it's probably just not properly configured to grant DS4Windows access to hidden controllers. Check HidHide's guide for more info on that. If you are definitely sure DS4W has been properly whitelisted by HidHide and it still can't detect the hidden devices try temporarily disabling it by opening the HidHide Configuration Client and unticking the Enable device hiding checkbox in the Devices tab If it still doesn't work then try uninstalling HidHide via Windows' Settings -> Apps and Features and rebooting If even with HidHide uninstalled your controller does not appear on Windows' Game Controllers list then the problem lies elsewhere Controller is a copy-cat/replica For these type of controllers to be detected by DS4Windows, they need to: or present themselves as a complete copy of the original in a way that DS4Windows actually thinks they are the original and also behaves exactly like a original one or have specific support for them on DS4Windows' code or try to force their detection by using the debug version of DS4Windows For more info on this, check the Adding support to third-party controllers page .

This page is dedicated to explaining why it fails to work sometimes, showing alternatives and, in case the user really needs this option for some reason, to finding out exactly why it's failing and how to solve it. Why it's not recommended When the Hide DS4 controllers option is enabled, DS4Windows will attempt to request Exclusive Access to detected controllers, meaning your real (physical) controller would not be detectable by games anymore. By keeping only DS4Windows' virtual controller visible the double input issue can be prevented. The problem is, if anything already has an open handle to the controller (games, programs, processes) then Windows will deny the Exclusive Access request and your real controller will remain visible. When this happens, DS4Windows will warn the user via the log tab as shown in the image below: Even when it does work, if the controller disconnects in the middle of a game chances are that the Exclusive Access request will fail upon controller reconnection, requiring the user to close the game/related programs before trying again. As such, this option is not realible and alternatives should be used. Recommended alternatives (HidHide) The recommended, trustworthy solution for preventing the double input issue is the HidHide driver . Once it has been installed and properly configured , the user's real controller will be hidden from games and other programs, with only DS4Windows and other chosen processes allowed to detect them. Applications known to cause problems with exclusive mode Important Even if it looks like a program is not open, sometimes it has a background process running, requiring the user to terminate it via Windows' Task Manager. To solve problems with exclusive mode you should try to close all other applications which may be using the real controller and then try to re-connect it (or ->Stop ->Start DS4Windows). If DS4Windows tool is the first application opening a connection to the controller then Exclusive Access can be acquireed and the real controller hidden. After Exclusive Access is obtained it will remain active until DS4Windows is stopped/started or the controller is reconnected. The following is a NOT complete list of applications which may be running in your system in the background and may have an open connection to the original DS4 controller. Sometimes very unexpected applications may have an open connection to the physical controller without your knowledge and then prevent DS4Windows to enable the \"Hide DS4 Controllers\" exclusive mode. NVIDIA GeForce Experience and in-game overlay Disable GeForce in-game overlay feature in NVIDIA options or enable it only after you have started DS4Windows tool. Steam client Steam client supports \"big screen mode\" and various gamepad controllers (including DualShock4). Disable gamepad support in Steam client at least for DualShock4 device type. Ubisoft UPlay client UPlay supports gamepad navigation. Close UPlay client before launching DS4Windows tool. Windows Store application Windows Store application supports gamepad controller navigations. Shutdown WinStore.app.exe process before launching DS4Windows tool. You can launch WinStore application after DS4Windows has already enabled the exclusive mode. Netflix (Win 10 app) Netflix client supports gamepad navigation.

In DS4Windows case, we refer to the time it takes for the system/DS4Windows to communicate with the controller. A high latency means a high input delay in games, meaning the time it takes for your character to respond to the controller commands. A high but stable input delay will make the users' character feel slow to respond, while a low input delay with high delay spikes may make the user prone to errors because of unexpected slow respond times. It's often considered that a really bad high latency is one where the input delay is above 20ms, though the ideal is to keep it bellow 10ms. Usual controller latency The following table can be used as reference for comparison on what input delay to expect with a supported controller and a good Bluetooth adapter: Take these values with a grain of salt No major technical experiments were done to obtain these values besides checking what DS4Windows usually informs when those controllers are used at maximum BT polling rate Controller Usual input delay Minimum input delay Notes DualShock 3 5ms 5ms Connected through BthPS3 + DsHidMini (DS4Windows Mode) DualShock 4 4ms - DS4W Default settings 1,5ms - polling rate set to maximum v1 and v2 don't have major latency differences DualSense 3ms 1ms Switch Pro controllers 16ms 16ms 16ms is the lowest latency the official controller can achieve Joy-cons 16ms? 16ms? Monitoring input delay You can check the current input delay by hovering your mouse above the controllers name on the Controllers tab (check the image above) If the controller's latency goes over 10ms then it will appear on the Log If you have a DualShock 3, DualShock 4 or DualSense you can enable the Flash Lighbar at High latency option in the Settings tab, which will make the lightbar flash in a red color when latency spikes are detected. For the DualShock 3 you need to have DsHidMini's Lightbar to LED translation enabled, then latency spikes will cause all 4 LEDs to quickly flash Input delay issues In case you are having issues with input delay, keep something in mind: DS4Windows itself is probably not the cause of whatever high input latency/latency spikes that you may have! 98% chance of the issue being elsewhere. Controllers do not communicate directly with DS4Windows via some driver, they connect to the default Windows' Bluetooth Stack and DS4Windows just receives and sends data to it through the channels given by Windows. If you are having latency issues then installing/uninstalling drivers won't fix them unless they are directly related to your dongle's driver. For this reason, messing with DS4Windows' related drivers will probably be a waste of time. Latency issues always boils down to: Low quality Bluetooth adapters (most integrated ones) High radio interference near the adapter Too many devices connected to the adapter Not using the correct/updated BT adapter's driver Causes of high or unstable latency Note on \"Bad\" BT adapters Keep in mind that when the term \"bad\" is used it does not necessarily mean \"cheap\". Multiple users have confirmed they have no latency issues even with 4 controllers connected with cheap, generic $5 adapters from Aliexpress Bluetooth and WiFi interference Both use the same frequency. Although they should auto adjust to prevent interference, sometimes it just happens. Check if your area isn't overloaded with different 2.4Ghz WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices. Also, if one of the signals is too weak then it's quite easy for the other to heavily interfere. Integrated or bad Bluetooth adapters It's quite common for integrated BT adapters to suck for one of the following reasons: They are inside the laptop's shell or inside a case that act as an obstacle to the signal The Bluetooth adapter also is the WiFi adapter and they are both interfering at each other They are just being overrall bad. Integrated BT adapters generally have short range and can't maintain the minimum data rate necessary when connecting more than 1 controller. Good integrated adapters are the exception, not the norm Though the minimum BT specification required for most modern controllers is the 2.1 specs, more modern adapters should have better signal stability. Multiple connected controllers Each connected controller means more data that is being transferred through the Bluetooth adapter. If you have a bad adapter or high radio interference near it it may not be able to maintain the required data rate between the system and controllers, causing high latency or even connection loss. Not much can be done besides trying to lower the interference or replacing the adater with a better one. A good quality adapter can easily maintain a stable, low latency connection with 4 controllers or even more. DS4Windows causing controller to increase data transfer rate This only applies to DS4 and DualSense controllers DS4 and DualSense controllers can communicate in 2 different modes: PC friendly mode: only basic button/axes information is sent by the controller to the PC Native PS mode: controller sends its full set of information, including motion sensors data, status, touchpad states etc When first connected to Windows, these controllers communicate in PC friendly mode and their data transfer rate is low. When picked by DS4Windows (or Steam for that matter), a request is sent for them to change into Native PS mode, which increases the volume and the frequency of data being sent. Not only that, DS4Windows also sends data back to the controller related to the rumble, lightbar, triggers (DualSense only) etc. When these changes occur, if the Bluetooth adapter can't keep up with the required data rate then the user may suffer with high input delay or even connection loss. So if your never had latency problems when using your DS4/DualSense in games as a generic controller but then start having issues when trying to use DS4Windows or Steam this may be the cause. Potential fixes to latency issues Test with WiFi fully disabled This test is recommended for those with integrated cards that work as both BT and WiFi adapters By disabling the WiFi signal you have one less source of radio interference so you can then verify your BT adapter performance in a environment with less signal noise. Keep wifi enabled devices far from the PC too. Settings Windows' Power Plan to High Performance Set the power saving plan of the PC to \"High Performance\" (usually the default in Win10 is balanced) On Windows' Device Manager locate your Bluetooth Dongle -> Enter its properties -> Check if there is a tab called Power Management and disable the turn off this device to save power (untick the option) Use a dedicated BT adapter Even if a dedicated adapter is already being used consider that it might be faulty or of bad quality A dedicated, good quality BT USB Adapter should offer better performance than an integrated one. Because its antenna is located outside of the laptop/desktop's shell, it also suffers less from signal loss caused by physical obstacles. When using a USB adapter in a PC that also has a integrated one the later must be disabled in Windows' Device Manager in order for the USB BT adapter one to be used, since Windows can only keep one dongle active. Moving the adapter to another USB port Moving the dongle to a better located USB port may offer a better quality signal. Also, USB ports (specially 3.0 and above) can be a source of radio noise. Test the dongle in different ports to verify which offer you a better signal. Connect USB BT adapter through a USB extension cable A laptop/desktop's shell is a source of radio noise, specially if it's ungrounded or near high powered, high data transfer ports like USB 3.0 and above. This noise may worsen your BT's adapter performance. Connecting your BT adapter through an active cable extension, so it stays located at some distance from the computers shell (not necessarily nearer to the controller), is known to be useful in these cases. Decrease the BT polling rate on profile settings Only works with DS4 gamepads. The BT polling rates of other types cannot be controlled On Profile Editor -> Other tab it's possible to set the BT Poll Rate used for DS4 and DualSense controllers on Bluetooth. If you are having latency issues, specially with multiple controllers connected, try setting this value to 10ms or more. For most games, a controller input delay is only noticeable above 16ms. Disable output data to the controller Your adapter may not be up to the task to both receive and send data to the controller. In this case, you can set a profile with the Enable output data to DS4 option disabled. Keep in mind that disabling this option will also disable Rumble and Lightbar control.","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#latencyinput-delay-issues-on-bluetooth","text":"","title":"Latency/input delay issues on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#general-information","text":"A connection latency is how much time it takes for one system to communicate to another.

To not keep repeating information all over the site, check the double input page for more information on that. Make sure your real controller is 100% hidden before playing games, otherwise you might start having double input/controller issues and mistake them for something else. If there is an X on the \"Ex\" column then it's possible for the double input issue to occur For users of HidHide, make sure that the HidHide Configuration Client is fully closed before opening DS4Windows, otherwise the \"Ex\" check may fail even though HidHide is correctly hiding the physical controller Test with a new, \"clean\", properly-functioning profile It's possible that the currently active profile is misconfigured, either by incorrectly tweaking settings or by having it broken after a DS4Windows update (really rare to happen, but possible). To not go into a wild goose-chase, the very first thing that should be done is creating a new, sure-to-be-working profile: Go to DS4Windows' Profiles tab and click on the New button to start profile creation A window will appear asking if the user wants to use a Preset. Select \"Yes\" then choose a Gamepad preset with Xbox or DualShock 4 output Choose any name for this profile (e.g.: \"testing\") then save it Go back to the Controllers tab and select the new profile This should result in a good profile for troubleshooting most issues. Most common issues Character or camera moves by themselves This is usually caused by the \"stick drifting\" issue, which happens when the controller stick position is not perfectly centered when at rest and can be possibly caused by 2 different hardware issues: The stick is not physically snapping back to its center or The stick being physically centered but the sticks' position sensors not correctly reading its position When using a preset Xbox profile (default settings), for the drift to not occur the stick's resting position must be below 8% of the total \"movement\" range. If above 8% then the stick position will fall outside of the default dead zone and DS4Windows will think the user is intentionally moving the stick. If using a DS4 preset profile (not related to the real controller you are using) then there are no (Anti) Dead Zone configured and DS4Windows just directly repasses the real stick position to the virtual DS4 controller. Instructions on how to properly verify the stick behavior Create a new profile and choose one of the Gamepad Presets DS4Windows recommends. Then adjust it to the following: Make this profile's name \"stick position test\" Set both the dead zone and anti dead zone to 0.00 in this new profile for both sticks (LS and RS) Select this profile on the main Controllers tab everytime you want to test your real stick behavior With this profile active, open the Gamepad Tester Website and verify if your stick is correctly centered when at a resting position Check the actual value of the axes. Values above +/- 0.08 are enough to cause drifting issues on DS4Windows default settings Even if it appears to be centered, try moving it to different positions and let it snap back to the center on its own many times to fully confirm it's properly functioning It's recommended to make this test MANY TIMES and at different periods. Sometimes the drift appears or disappears randomly, making it hard to properly confirm if the stick is 100% OK If possible, when the random camera movement is perceived mid-game try to quickly alt-tab and test this to check the stick position A minor but constant drift can be workarounded by increasing the dead zone (check the Minor drift workaround example below). If you are suffering from major drift then there's not much that can be done besides repairing the controller itself. Depending on the controller, it can be fixed by cleaning the sticks' resistor-meters (not so hard to people who are confident of their DIY abilities) or fully replacing the sticks (advanced stuff, take it to the assistance). Stick drift issue and workarounds When not being moved, the sticks positions must be centered Issue example (minor) The Right Stick is at the correct resting position The Left stick's horizontal axis is slightly drifting to the right ( axis 0 = ~0.16 ) This can be \"fixed\" by increasing the dead zone on the profile settings Issue example (major) The Left Stick's both axes are suffering from major drifting issues Setting a dead zone big enough to counter this might greatly affect gameplay and even make games unplayable Fixing it requires cleaning the stick sensors or replacing the stick (not for the average user) Minor drift workaround The Black Dot (real stick position) must be inside the Red Area (Dead Zone) so that DS4Windows makes the Gray Dot (Virtual Stick Position) centered For this controller's Left Stick, a Dead Zone of 23% was required to counter its drift Occasionally character or camera moves in a random direction or not respond to the exact movement that is expected This is usually related to a hardware issue called \"Stick drifting\" that happens when the controller's not correctly reading the stick position, which can cause it to \"jump\" to random positions when using it. To verify, it's needed to verify the stick in all possible positions: Instructions on how to properly verify the stick behavior Create a new profile and choose one of the Gamepad Presets DS4Windows recommends. Then adjust it to the following: Make this profile's name \"stick position test\" Set both the dead zone and anti dead zone to 0.00 in this new profile for both sticks (LS and RS) Select this profile on the main Controllers tab everytime you want to test your real stick behavior Open the Gamepad Tester Website Do, slowly, a cross movement by makign the stick position go up-and-down, left-and-right. Test both sticks separately Also, slowly do a full circle movement a few times It's recommended to make the 2 tests above MANY TIMES and at different periods. Sometimes the drift appears or disappears randomly making it hard to properly confirm if the stick is 100% Ok If when testing the stick position corresponded to the movements of the real stick then all good. If not, if somehow it jumped position or behave erratically then your controller probably is physically faulty. Depending on the controller, it can be fixed by cleaning the sticks' resistor-meters (not so hard to people who are confident of their DIY abilities) or fully replacing the sticks (advanced stuff, take it to the assistance). Example of how proper functioning sticks moves like Buttons / triggers pressing themselves randomly or not registering properly Random inputs are 99.9% of the time caused by the controller itself being faulty, not by DS4Windows or other drivers. If the issue is in the triggers, it's possible to try increasing its/their dead-zone to require pressing them further before being registered. One way to test if you are having random buttom presses is by creating a profile that has a Special action enabled that causes a profile switch to another profile when a specific button is pressed, then just leave your controller turned on and wait, or maybe try slightly touching the buttons without fully pressing them to see if its a sensibility issue. Other than that, the only thing left to do is taking the controller to the assistance. Usual reaction when users say it's a Windows' driver error Controller stops responding randomly Unless DS4Windows is out-right crashing or appearing to be frozen (Windows says that it is not responding) then it is probably an issue with your controllers cable, its own USB port, the PC's USB port or if connected via Bluetooth then a latency issue . For wired users, try using other PC USB ports, replacing the cable or testing if the problem does not occur when connected over Bluetooth. Besides that, check if there isn't any error message in DS4Windows' Log that could give some direction on this. Game constantly or occasionally feels slow to respond to commands (high input delay sensation) May be an issue with the game itself If the controller is connected via Bluetooth then you may be having connection issues which result in high input delay or random latency spikes Controller latency can be monitored by hovering the mouse over the controllers' name on DS4Windows' main Controllers tab. Also, if the latency goes above 10ms then it will be registered on the Log tab If you are connected wired but DS4Windows is alerting you of high input delay (over 20ms) then probably the cable is faulty, or even the PC or controller's USB port Game feels slow to respond to commands only when using a virtual DS4 (HidHide related) This was an issue with HidHide that was fixed on v1.1.50. Make sure to update to the latest available HidHide version . Game has native support to DS4's rumble, motion, gyro, touchpad and/or lightbar but it does not work Rumble and lightbar passthrough are currently disabled when DS4 emulation is active Because of an issue with the ViGEmBus, DS4Windows has disabled support for rumble and the Lightbar passthru mode when using virtual DS4 controllers The issue causes the controller to occasionally not stop rumbling or to set wrong lightbar colors The last version to have these features enabled was v3.0.10. Keep in mind that these features may or may not work well with games in this version and support will not be given to users that aren't to the latest version Are you reeeeeally sure it actually has support for those features? One good way of knowing, though not 100% reliable, is by looking in your games' page on the PC Gaming Wiki and checking in the controller section if it has 1) DS4 Controller support and 2) if it's specifically stated that those functions are supported Make sure you are using a emulated DS4 controller and that you've enabled the corresponding passthru options that you intend to use on the active profile Sometimes, for a game to have support for these features (or to even detect DS4 controllers) the following conditions are required: 1) launching the game through Steam and 2) Using the DS4 controller through Steam's Playstation Configuration Support .
