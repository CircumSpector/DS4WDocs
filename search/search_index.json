If a game can detect both the real and the virtual controller at the same time then it will detect 2 different controllers responding to button presses everytime, which can lead to the infamous double-input issue. Depending on the game, this can make the game unplayable. The fix to this is to prevent games/the system from recognizing your real controller, leaving only the virtual one associated to it visible. This can be done in two ways: HidHide (recommended) DS4Windows' Hide DS4 controllers option (mostly, not recommended) Methods to prevent the issue HidHide (recommended) HidHide is a driver that acts as a barrier between Windows and every HID Device connected (physical peripherals). It allows the user to selectively hide controllers and only allow specific software to see them. This is the recommended method because once it has been properly setup you are good to go. In DS4W case, the user needs to set HidHide to: Hide the used controllers from the system, both from USB and Bluetooth Allow DS4Windows to see them, otherwise it would think there are no supported controllers connected Connected controller needs to be hidden individually . Also, the same controller needs to be hidden one time when used by USB and another when used by Bluetooth! HidHide has its own dedicated setup page . Users who know more or less what they are doing can follow the quick setup section and for the ones having trouble there is also the step-by-step section. After installing the HidHide driver you MUST reboot your system before using it Hide DS4 Controllers option (legacy) Note to users of HidHide If you have HidHide installed and correctly setup it's recommended to leave this option disabled except in some edge case This option exists on DS4Windows Settings tab. When it is active, DS4Windows will kindly ask windows for exclusive access to the controller, meaning Windows would only allow DS4Windows to detect it, preventing then the double input issue. The problem with this method is that Windows can deny the exclusive access request when another process already has a open connection to the controller.

In DS4Windows case, we refer to the time it takes for the system/DS4Windows to communicate with the controller. A high latency means a high input delay in games, meaning the time it takes for your character to respond to the controller commands. A high but stable input delay will make your character feel slow to respond, while a low input delay with high delay spikes may make you prone to errors since your character may suddenly be slow to respond when you are not expecting it to. It's often considered that a really bad high latency is one where the input delay is above 20ms, though the ideal is to keep it bellow 10ms. Usual controller latency The following table can be used as reference for comparison on what input delay to expect with a supported controller and a good Bluetooth Adapter. Keep in mind it was made by checking the usual input delay values DS4Windows informs when comparing the time between commands sent by the controller. As such, no major technical experiments were done to obtain these values and they should be taken with a grain of salt. Controller Usual input delay Notes DualShock 3 ~5ms Connected through BthPS3 + DsHidMini (DS4Windows Mode) DualShock 4 ~4ms v1 and v2 don't have major latency differences DualSense ~3ms Switch Pro controllers ~16ms 16ms is the lowest latency the official controller can achieve Joy-cons ? Monitoring input delay You can check the current input delay by hovering your mouse above the controllers name on the Controllers tab (check the image above) If the controller's latency goes over 10ms then it will appear on the Log If you have a DualShock 3, DualShock 4 or DualSense you can enable the Flash Lighbar at High latency option in the Settings tab, which will make the lightbar flash in a red color when latency spikes are detected. For the DualShock 3 you need to have DsHidMini's Lightbar to LED translation enabled, then latency spikes will cause all 4 LEDs to quickly flash High input delay In case you are having issues with input delay, keep something in mind: DS4Windows itself is probably not the cause of whatever high input latency/latency spikes that you may have! 98% chance of the issue being elsewhere. Controllers do not communicate directly with DS4Windows via some driver, they connect to the default Windows' Bluetooth Stack and DS4Windows just receives and sends data to it through the channels given by Windows. If you are having latency issues then installing/uninstalling drivers won't fix them unless they are directly related to your dongle's driver. For this reason, messing with DS4Windows' related drivers will probably be a waste of time. Latency issues always boils down to: Bad, cheap or integrated Bluetooth adapters High radio interference near the adapter Too many devices connected to the adapter Not using the correct/updated BT adapter's driver Causes of high or unstable latency Note on \"Bad\" BT adapters Keep in mind that when the term \"bad\" is used it does not necessarily mean \"cheap\". Multiple users have confirmed they have no latency issues even with 4 controllers connected with cheap, generic $5 adapters from Aliexpress Bluetooth and WiFi interference Both use the same frequency. Although they should auto adjust to prevent interference, sometimes it just happens. Check if your area isn't overloaded with different 2.4Ghz WiFi networks and Bluetooth devices. Integrated or bad Bluetooth adapters It's quite common for integrated BT adapters to suck for one of the following reasons: They are inside the laptop's shell or inside a case that act as an obstacle to the signal The Bluetooth adapter also is the WiFi adapter and they are both interfering at each other They are just being overrall bad. Integrated BT adapters generally have short range and can't maintain the minimum data rate necessary when connecting more than 1 controller. Good integrated adapters are the exception, not the norm Though the minimum BT specification required for most modern controllers is the 2.1 specs, more modern adapters should have better signal stability. Multiple connected controllers Each connected controller means more data that is being transferred through the Bluetooth adapter. If you have a bad adapter or high radio interference near it it may not be able to maintain the required data rate between the system and controllers, causing high latency or even connection loss. Not much can be done besides trying to lower the interference or switching adaters. DS4Windows settings Some general info on DS4Windows and mainly DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers. When a DS4 or DualSense is first connected to it, they present themselves in a limited form. They don't send the data related to rumble, motion sensors, lightbar etc. Meaning they are sending just basic buttons and axis states info and Windows is basically not sending anything back. After DS4Windows first detects the controller it sends a request for it to change to full feature mode, where the missing info starts being sent. DS4Windows also starts then sending rumble, lightbar and triggers (DualSense only) data back to it. Mind you, Steam sends the same request when the Playstation Configuration Support option is enabled. This change from limited to full feature mode results in a increase of data rate between the controller and the system and sometimes the adapter can't keep up with it. So, if your never had latency problems when using your DS4/DualSense in games with generic controller support but then start having them after start using DS4Windows or Steam, this is the cause. Suggestion on lowering BT latency Test with WiFi fully disabled Mostly recommended for testing with integrated cards that double as both BT and WiFi adapters By disabling the WiFi signal you have one less source of radio interference so you can then verify your BT adapter performance in a environment with less signal noise. Keep wifi enabled devices far from the PC too. Settings Windows' Power Plan to High Performance Set the power saving plan of the PC to \"High Performance\" (usually the default in Win10 is balanced) On Windows' Device Manager locate your Bluetooth Dongle -> Enter its properties -> Check if there is a tab called Power Management and disable the turn off this device to save power (untick the option) Use a dedicated BT adapter Recommended for users of integrated BT adapter users A dedicated, good quality BT USB Adapter should offer better performance than a integrated one. Because its antenna is located outside of the laptop/desktop's shell, it also suffers less from signal loss caused by physical obstacles. Moving the adapter to another USB port Moving the dongle to a better located USB port may offer a better quality signal. Also, USB ports (specially 3.0 and above) can be a source of radio noise. Test the dongle in different ports to verify which offer you a better signal. Connect USB BT Dongle through a USB extension cable A laptop/desktop's shell is a source of radio noise, specially near high powered, high data transfer ports like USB 3.0 and above. This noise may worsen your BT's adapter performance. Connecting your BT adapter through a cable extension so it stays located at some distance from the computers shell is known to be useful in these cases. Disable output data to the controller Your adapter may not be up to the task to both receive and send data to the controller. In this case, you can set a profile with the Enable output data to DS4 option disabled. Keep in mind that Output Data means data that DS4Windows sends back to the controller like rumble and lightbar states, with both also be disabled in this case.","title":"Input delay on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#input-delay-on-bluetooth","text":"","title":"Input delay on Bluetooth"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#general-information","text":"A connection latency is how much time it takes for one system to communicate to another.

Controller Usual input delay Notes DualShock 3 ~5ms Connected through BthPS3 + DsHidMini (DS4Windows Mode) DualShock 4 ~4ms v1 and v2 don't have major latency differences DualSense ~3ms Switch Pro controllers ~16ms 16ms is the lowest latency the official controller can achieve Joy-cons ?","title":"Usual controller latency"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#monitoring-input-delay","text":"You can check the current input delay by hovering your mouse above the controllers name on the Controllers tab (check the image above) If the controller's latency goes over 10ms then it will appear on the Log If you have a DualShock 3, DualShock 4 or DualSense you can enable the Flash Lighbar at High latency option in the Settings tab, which will make the lightbar flash in a red color when latency spikes are detected. For the DualShock 3 you need to have DsHidMini's Lightbar to LED translation enabled, then latency spikes will cause all 4 LEDs to quickly flash","title":"Monitoring input delay"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#high-input-delay","text":"In case you are having issues with input delay, keep something in mind: DS4Windows itself is probably not the cause of whatever high input latency/latency spikes that you may have! 98% chance of the issue being elsewhere. Controllers do not communicate directly with DS4Windows via some driver, they connect to the default Windows' Bluetooth Stack and DS4Windows just receives and sends data to it through the channels given by Windows. If you are having latency issues then installing/uninstalling drivers won't fix them unless they are directly related to your dongle's driver. For this reason, messing with DS4Windows' related drivers will probably be a waste of time. Latency issues always boils down to: Bad, cheap or integrated Bluetooth adapters High radio interference near the adapter Too many devices connected to the adapter Not using the correct/updated BT adapter's driver","title":"High input delay"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#causes-of-high-or-unstable-latency","text":"Note on \"Bad\" BT adapters Keep in mind that when the term \"bad\" is used it does not necessarily mean \"cheap\".

Integrated BT adapters generally have short range and can't maintain the minimum data rate necessary when connecting more than 1 controller. Good integrated adapters are the exception, not the norm Though the minimum BT specification required for most modern controllers is the 2.1 specs, more modern adapters should have better signal stability.","title":"Integrated or bad Bluetooth adapters"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#multiple-connected-controllers","text":"Each connected controller means more data that is being transferred through the Bluetooth adapter. If you have a bad adapter or high radio interference near it it may not be able to maintain the required data rate between the system and controllers, causing high latency or even connection loss. Not much can be done besides trying to lower the interference or switching adaters.","title":"Multiple connected controllers"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#ds4windows-settings","text":"Some general info on DS4Windows and mainly DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers. When a DS4 or DualSense is first connected to it, they present themselves in a limited form. They don't send the data related to rumble, motion sensors, lightbar etc. Meaning they are sending just basic buttons and axis states info and Windows is basically not sending anything back. After DS4Windows first detects the controller it sends a request for it to change to full feature mode, where the missing info starts being sent. DS4Windows also starts then sending rumble, lightbar and triggers (DualSense only) data back to it. Mind you, Steam sends the same request when the Playstation Configuration Support option is enabled. This change from limited to full feature mode results in a increase of data rate between the controller and the system and sometimes the adapter can't keep up with it. So, if your never had latency problems when using your DS4/DualSense in games with generic controller support but then start having them after start using DS4Windows or Steam, this is the cause.","title":"DS4Windows settings"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#suggestion-on-lowering-bt-latency","text":"","title":"Suggestion on lowering BT latency"},{"location":"troubleshooting/input-delay-bt/#test-with-wifi-fully-disabled","text":"Mostly recommended for testing with integrated cards that double as both BT and WiFi adapters By disabling the WiFi signal you have one less source of radio interference so you can then verify your BT adapter performance in a environment with less signal noise.
