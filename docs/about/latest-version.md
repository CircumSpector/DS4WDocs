            1. Uninstall current version
            1. Reboot
            1. Install latest version
            1. Reboot again
    - Ryochan7's FakerInput v0.1
        - It's installed by DS4Windows itself, so just make sure you are on DS4Windows latest version

## Current state of the DS4Windows project

- The developer Ryochan7 is currently updating DS4Windows. His version is the one that should be used by users
- The  CircumSpector Team is also reworking the DS4Windows code in their own branch, but it will take a good while until things are stable
    - There are no user-ready versions
    - Those trying to compile from source-code will end-up with something that will probably not work since things are in mid-rework
