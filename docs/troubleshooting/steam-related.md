## Issue: user unable to control Big Picture using a DS4 controller. Steam doesn't recognize DS4 controllers

Steam ignores every real or virtual DS4 controller if it detects DS4Windows is running. To work around this, it is necessary to [run DS4Windows under a custom ".exe" name](../../guides/ds4w-custom-name/).

## General info regarding Steam's `(Controller type) Configuration Support` options

!!! note "To Do"

## "Do I need these options enabled for Steam games to recognize my controller?"

### The simple answer

No, you can disable those options and games should have no trouble recognizing your controller. Keep in mind that [not all games have native support for DS4 controllers](../../other/under-construction), and of those that do have most of the time don't support its force-feedback (rumble) functions or lightbar.

### The long answer

!!! note "To Do"
    This section is mostly incomplete

- Some games natively support DualShock 4 controllers with Playstation button icon but require Steam's `Playstation Config(...)` to have working force-feedback (rumble)
- Some games fully rely on Steam's `Playstation Config(...)` to detect DS4 controllers and display Playstation button icons / have working rumble / lightbar control
